Outside the lab, you may probably find me hanging on a wall over the many crags in Catalunya. 
Especially, you may find me in Gelida (close to Barcelona), trying to solve a range of routes that seem impossible to me right now.
I'm not a professional; quite the opposite, I'm a newbie sport climber.  

In this tab, I intend to list my achievements in the climbing world, as well as some projects that are still ongoing.
