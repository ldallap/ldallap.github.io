Outside the lab, you may find me hanging on a wall over the many crags in Catalunya. 
Especially, you may find me in Gelida (close to Barcelona), trying to solve a range of routes that seem impossible to me right now.
I'm a newbie sport climber who climbs for pure pleasure and self-improvement.  

In this tab, I intend to list my achievements in the climbing world, as well as some projects that are still ongoing.  

**Redpoint**  
* 7a/5.11d: _Sarai_, 23/11/01 - Font-freda, Gelida/ES.  
  Awesome route. It consists of 7 quickdraws, where you can move nicely and without too much trouble to the last bolt. There you find the crux of the route. My beta was to go right hand to the high pinch while holding a small left crimper. Raise left foot in a slippery foothold, and then move left hand to the very good two-finger pocket on the left. The route is completed from there. Update: I repeated this route following a straight line from the ground, and not taking the holds at the right.

* 7a+/5.12a: _L'arquemag_, 23/11/11 - Font-freda, Gelida/ES.  
  Gelida style. 7 quickdraws long. 2 boulder problems at the start (3ish movements each) followed by good rests. The following is accessible until the last bolt where the crux starts. The last move is shared with Sarai (7a; left-side). Nice and recommended climb.  

* 7a/5.11d; _N.N. (no28) / Climb Around B no19_, 23/12/27 - Font-freda, Gelida/ES.
  Tough day. I set the quickdraws resting and checking the steps. I didnÂ´t find any special hard move and thought it would be an easy ascent. But yeah, the rock is ruthless. I had a nice flight on the third quickdraw. I tried it again but was too pumped to finish. It's definitely a route of consistency. For another day.
  Redpoint on 24/01/03. Ascent done while placing the quickdraws. This route is about consistency. Take good rest when possible and move up.

* 7a+/5.12a; _Chapas negras_, 24/01/03 - Font-freda, Gelida/ES.  
  Beautiful route. The crux is in the middle of the route just before getting to the "big eye". There are 3 small crimps that you need to cross before getting to a jug on the left, inside the "big eye". From there the route is about endurance, with no hard moves in what follows next. After the last quickdraw before the chain, you go through the right. Once on the top, you do a small traverse to the left and clip the chain.
  Redpoint on 24/02/02. Ascent done while placing the quickdraws. Taking profit from the resting positions and with a clear focus, everything went fine.

**Projects**
* None for now
