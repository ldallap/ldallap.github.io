Hello, I'm Leonardo. I´m a research scientist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Dr. Maria V. Sanchez-Vives at IDIBAPS, located in Barcelona, Spain.
My research primarily focuses on the properties of the cerebral cortex. Cortical state transitions; how intrinsic properties shape collective dynamics and their impact at the whole-brain level; emergent properties and their dependence on cortical states (brain criticality); oscillations and neuronal communication across brain areas; modulation of isolated cortical circuits and their properties; all these are topics I've been working on. 
To address these questions I work mostly on computational simulations and analyzing/developing methods for electrophysiological (single/multi-unit, LFP, ECoG) recordings.

If you’d like to get in touch, you can reach me at *leonardodallaporta[at]gmail[dot]com*.
