Hello, I'm Leonardo. I´m a research scientist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Dr. Maria V. Sanchez-Vives at IDIBAPS, located in Barcelona, Spain.
My research is aimed to unravel the brain's functional organization and elucidate the mechanisms governing cortical state transitions.
To achieve this, I work mostly on computational simulations and developing methods for analyzing single-unit and multi-unit electrophysiological neural activity.
